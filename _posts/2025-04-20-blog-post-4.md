We hear it all the time, especially lately: slap tariffs on imports, and *poof*, the trade deficit shrinks, and maybe manufacturing jobs come flooding back. It's an intuitive idea. Make foreign stuff more expensive, people buy less of it, imports go down, deficit fixed. Right?

Well, like a lot of things in economics, it's a bit more complicated than that. A recent [paper](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/u7mj4q85twy2m4db0mufu/TBtariffsCostinotWerning.pdf?rlkey=dhdlthz33ty6zsehj2rnqwvne&dl=0) by Arnaud Costinot and Iván Werning digs into this very question: *can* permanent tariffs actually reduce a trade deficit? Not *should* they (that's a different, though related, question), but *can* they?

Their answer, in true economist fashion, is: "It depends."

Engel Curves and Why They Matter
------

The core idea boils down to something called "Engel curves." Basically, an Engel curve (named after statistician Ernst Engel, not Friedrich) looks at how our spending patterns change as our overall consumption changes.

In this paper's context, they look at an Engel curve for *trade*. How do a country's *aggregate* imports and exports change as its total consumption goes up or down? Their big finding is that tariffs are more likely to reduce a trade deficit if this trade Engel curve is "convex."

What does "convex" mean here? Think of it like this: a convex curve means that as a country consumes more (gets richer, effectively), its demand for imports tends to grow *faster* than its exports. It develops a bigger appetite for foreign goods relative to its outbound shipments. This often happens when, as consumption rises, goods that weren't traded before start getting imported, or goods that were exported stop being exported (economists call this the "extensive margin").

The Mechanism: It's About Time (Travel?)
------

So, why does this convexity matter for tariffs? The paper connects this to an idea explored previously by economists Obstfeld and Rogoff. Tariffs don't just make stuff more expensive today; they subtly change the cost of consuming *today* versus consuming *tomorrow*.

Think about a country running a trade deficit. It's essentially consuming more than it produces *now* and borrowing from the future (planning to run a surplus later to pay it back). Consumption is higher in the deficit period.

If the Engel curve is convex, this higher consumption during the deficit period means the country is *especially* reliant on imports relative to exports during that time. A tariff, therefore, hits harder – it makes consumption significantly more expensive specifically in these high-consumption, high-import deficit periods compared to future surplus periods.

This effectively makes borrowing from the future (running a deficit today) less attractive. It creates a little wedge between domestic and world interest rates, nudging people and firms to save a bit more today and consume a bit less, thereby shrinking the deficit.

If the Engel curve *isn't* convex (if it's linear), tariffs raise costs more evenly across deficit and surplus periods. The incentive to shift consumption across time disappears, and tariffs don't do much to the trade balance. This is the "neutrality" result the paper highlights.

But Hold On... Is This a Good Idea?
------

So, the positive analysis says tariffs *can* work, *if* those Engel curves are shaped the right way (which the authors suspect might be true in reality due to that "extensive margin" stuff).

But here's the kicker: even the paper's authors caution against it.

1.  **Blunt Tool Alert:** They call tariffs a "blunt tool." Why? Because while they *might* nudge the trade deficit slightly, they do so by mucking up all sorts of other things. They reduce the overall volume of trade (which is generally beneficial), distort production and consumption decisions, and raise prices. It's like using a sledgehammer to adjust a wristwatch.
2.  **Modest Effects Likely:** The impact on the deficit probably isn't even that big unless you use *really* high tariffs (think 50%+), which would cause massive economic disruption.
3.  **Retaliation Isn't Included:** The model assumes other countries just sit there and take it. In reality? They retaliate, leading to trade wars that hurt everyone and likely negate any small deficit reduction.
4.  **Normative vs. Positive:** The authors explicitly state that while their model shows tariffs *can* affect deficits (positive analysis), it also suggests they *shouldn't* be used for this purpose (normative conclusion). The economic costs just aren't worth the (likely small) benefit on the deficit front.

The Bigger Picture: Why Deficits Happen (and Why Tariffs Are the Wrong Fix)
------

Most economists argue that trade deficits aren't fundamentally about trade policy anyway. They're about savings and investment. A country runs a trade deficit when its total investment exceeds its total savings. Foreign money (capital inflows) comes in to finance that gap.

For the US, this is often seen as less worrying than for other countries. Thanks to the dollar's role as the global reserve currency (the "exorbitant privilege"), the US can borrow cheaply in its own currency to finance deficits. Often, these deficits reflect strong investment demand or consumers simply enjoying access to global goods. They aren't necessarily a sign of economic sickness.

If you *are* worried about a deficit, the standard economic toolkit points towards fiscal policy (like managing government budget deficits) and monetary policy, which influence overall saving and investment, rather than gumming up the works of international trade with tariffs.

So, next time you hear someone confidently say tariffs will slash the trade deficit, remember the Costinot and Werning paper. The answer isn't a simple "yes." It's a nuanced "maybe, under specific conditions, but it's probably a bad idea anyway." Tariffs might offer a simple-sounding solution, but the economic reality is far more complex, and the potential collateral damage is huge.
