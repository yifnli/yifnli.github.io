## About me

I'm an economist with expertise in international trade, development economics, and applied econometrics at [UNESCO Institute for Statistics](https://uis.unesco.org/). My research examines how trade liberalization and global market integration affect firm productivity, resource allocation, and economic outcomes in developing countries.

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Ngo Van Long](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/faculty-0/ngo-van-long) and [Prof. Francesco Amodio](https://francescoamodio.com/).

You can find my CV here: [Yifan Li's Curriculum Vitae](/cv/).
