## About me

I am an economist specializing in international trade and development economics. My research focuses on examining the economic implications of external shocks on firm performance, market structure and industrial organization. Recently, I investigate how transformative technologies—including big data analytics, generative AI (GenAI), large language models (LLMs), and industrial automation—reshape production functions, alter industry dynamics, and influence patterns of global trade and data flows.

Currently, I serve as a Statistician at at [UNESCO Institute for Statistics](https://uis.unesco.org/), where I work with statistical data related to global education and social policy indicators. Prior to this, I worked in both academia and various international organizations including UN Secretariat (New York), International Civil Aviation Organizations (Montreal) and Asian Development Bank (Manila)

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Ngo Van Long](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/ngo-van-long) and [Prof. Francesco Amodio](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/francesco-amodio/).
